           Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 â€“ April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist, business magnate, founder of the Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production. By creating the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, he converted the automobile from an expensive luxury into an accessible conveyance that profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.

              About the Legend
          </h1>
          <p>
            His introduction of the Ford Model T automobile revolutionized transportation and American industry.  
            <br><br> He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. He is credited with "Fordism", the mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers.
            <br><br> Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.
            <br><br>
            Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout North America and major cities on six continents. 
            <br><br>
            In July 1938, four months after the German annexation of Austria, Ford accepted the highest medal that Nazi Germany bestowed on a foreigner, the Grand Cross of the Order of the German Eagle.
            <br><br> Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation and arranged for his family to permanently control it.
